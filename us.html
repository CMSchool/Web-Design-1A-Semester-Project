                Our program is an afterschool program funded through a 21st Century grant, offered through the federal government. We focus on all things anime and manga related. We focus on creating original digital and traditional art, using various methods. Students are free to discuss anime programing and manga graphic novels, under the supervision of a staff facilitator. Students also trade and play various anime/manga trading cards. This is a safe place for students, who will NOT be judged based on their fandom of the anime/manga world.
